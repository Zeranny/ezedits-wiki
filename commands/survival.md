# Survival

All sub-commands are under `//ezsurvival` (`//ezsv`) e.g `//ezsv deinfest`

## `//ezsurvival ...`

### `deinfest`

**`//ezsv deinfest`**

Replaces infested blocks with their non-infested counterpart. For example, `infested_stone` will become `stone`

### `persist`

**`//ezsv persist [ON|OFF]`**

Toggles leaf block persistence on or off. Having persistence on prevents leaf decay.

### `wax`

**`//ezsv wax [ON|OFF]`**

Toggles waxing of copper blocks and signs on or off. Waxing copper blocks prevents them changing states due to age. Waxing signs prevents them from being edited.
