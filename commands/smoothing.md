# Smoothing

### `//ezsmooth`

<details>

<summary>Smooth</summary>

**`//ezsmooth <radii> <iterations> <bias>`**

**`Alias: //ezsm`**

The `//ezsmooth` command smooths the edges and surfaces of a selected region using a 3 dimensional smoothing algorithm.

* **Radii**: The smoothing radius or radii, which can be a single value or three comma-separated values for the East/West, Up/Down, and North/South directions, respectively. This parameter controls the extent of the smoothing effect.
* **Iterations**: The number of times the smoothing operation is executed. More iterations lead to a smoother outcome but increase processing time.
* **Bias**: A value between -1.0 and 1.0 that adjusts the smoothing effect's expansion or contraction. Positive values expand the smoothed area, while negative values contract it.

### `//ezinflate`

<details>

<summary>Inflate</summary>

**`//ezinflate <radius>`**

**`Alias: //inflate`**

The `//ezinflate` command expands the volume of blocks within a selected region by a specified amount, effectively "inflating" the build.

* **Radius**: Specifies the expansion distance in blocks. This value determines how far from the original surfaces the new, inflated surfaces will be created.

</details>

### `//ezdeflate`

<details>

<summary>Deflate</summary>

**`//ezdeflate <radius>`**

**`Alias: //deflate`**

The `//ezdeflate` command contracts the volume of blocks within a selected region by a specified amount, effectively "deflating" the build.

* **Radius**: Specifies the expansion distance in blocks. This value determines how far inwards from the original surfaces that blocks will be removed.

</details>

### `//ezsmoothblocks` (v0.13.1 and older)

<details>

<summary>Smooth Blocks</summary>

**`//ezsmoothblocks <radius> <iterations> <bias> [-s] [-t] [-w]`**

**`Alias: //smoothblocks`**

The `//ezsmoothblocks` command modifies a selected region by placing slabs, stairs, and walls to create a significantly smoother surface.

* **Radius**: Specifies the smoothing radius in blocks. This value determines the area around each block that is considered during the smoothing process.
* **Iterations**: The number of times the smoothing operation is executed. More iterations result in a smoother outcome but increase processing time.
* **Bias**: A value between -1.0 and 1.0 that adjusts the smoothing effect's expansion or contraction. Positive values tend to expand the smoothed area, while negative values contract it, offering control over the final appearance.
* **-s**: Limits the smoothing process to only use slabs.
* **-t**: Excludes walls from smoothing.
* **-w**: Uses an alternative set of blocks.
